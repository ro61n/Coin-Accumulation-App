# Coin-Accumulation-App
A basic web-app that compares the value of cryptocurrency coins over time to assist in accumulating coins. Developed with HTML, PHP and Javascript. Working demo available at the following subdomain: http://thescrollingmall.com/CMC/cmc.php

# Note:
- This is a demo
- When you need to select a date for the investment, most won't produce proper proper outputs as the code was not run on those dates to collect market data from those dates. Two dates that definitely work are 22-02-2019 and the 13-10-2018.
